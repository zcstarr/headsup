### What is

Feedhead is an NFT Feed. Traditionally media is produced by various people writing blogs, or in a larger media sense creating magazines. The platforms are still heavily powered by websites like WordPress or custom websites. This is mostly because of content management systems and the lack of utility in changing operations. 

NFTs give power to the holder. What if we reimagine media companies and platforms as NFTs themselves? 

Users, collaborators, and curators can simply opt-in to minting the NFT feed and by holding it in their wallet subscribe to the feed. 

The feed supports MarkDown, IPFS links, and/or images that are written on-chain using the erc725 standard to store the data.  Taking this a step further,  the NFT feed is translated into an RSS Feed by our API servers. Your NFT Feed can now directly tie into other feed ecosystems that already exist in web 2.0

The novelty is that when we look at NFTs from a point of view of access, we can change the dynamics of the way we structure media groups and companies. 

### A view towards the Future. 

Sara and Fischer, are starting a food media empire, right now it's just the two of them, but they want to create a new kind of structure. Creating a token curated registry for their content. Users that believe in the feed pay to join the feed, by minting the feed token. 

They use their token ownership, to curate the content. Because they're all holders of the NFT it's easy to distribute rewards for enticing advertisers, and building partnerships, to join their feed. It's also easy to then create tokens from posts, that can then be exchanged with other partners. 

### Another Case

A group of friends has a great idea for posting some of the memes and content they're creating and want to create a newsletter. Instead, they use Feedhead to create an NFT feed and update it with each artist's work with a mint button to mint feed entries directly from the feed. Some of the mints are exclusive to FEED holders only. Making being on the allowlist valuable. 



The possibilities for restructuring media are endless.
