# HeadsUP 
 A simple nft newsletter factory contract. Making an newsletter has never been so easy. Allow users to mint an NFT that is auto subscribed 
 to newsletter updates. Use this same NFT as gate into your community. Provide an easy way to provide your community with updates. 1 NFT == 
 1 perpetually updating set of Newsletters.

## What's this 
Create a new newsletter by using our factory contract to deploy a new newsletter of your choosing. 
Use our update page to update your newsletter content. The updates are applied to your existing metadata contract,
and therefore automatically distributed to all holders of your newsletter NFT. If a user wants to unsubscribe they simply burn the NFT.

The newsletter content is assumed to be written in markdown.
